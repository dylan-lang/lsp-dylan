# Dylan Language Server

This is an implementation of the [Language Server
Protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/) for
Dylan.


## Current Status

As of 2022-11-07, the server implements

* Jump to declaration
* Jump to definition
* Diagnostics (i.e., compiler warnings)
* Hover (i.e., argument lists)

When applied to a symbol which is bound to a generic function, "jump to
definition" will show a list containing the generic function and its specific
methods, whereas "jump to declaration" will jump straight to the generic
function.

We are currently using version [3.15 of the LSP
protocol](https://microsoft.github.io/language-server-protocol/specifications/specification-3-15/).


## Opening Projects

The LSP server needs to be able to open a project (that is, a Dylan library)
associated with the file you're editing when you turn on LSP in your editor. It
assumes you are using a [dylan-tool](https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-tool)
workspace and searches for a project to open as follows:

1. If there is a `workspace.json` file and that file has a `"default-library"`
   property, the specified library is opened.

2. It uses `dylan-tool` to choose a library defined in the workspace. This is
   [generally](https://github.com/dylan-lang/dylan-tool/blob/292b7bf761745c9fa810511c9888f802dd787011/sources/workspaces/workspaces.dylan#L151)
   the test suite library, if one exists.

Normally you shouldn't need to set any environment variables; everything is
derived from the full pathname to the `dylan-compiler` executable, which must
be on your `PATH`.

## Emacs Usage

1. Make sure the `dylan-lsp-server` executable is on your `PATH`, or customize
   the `lsp-dylan-exe-pathname` elisp variable. See below for more on
   customization.

1. Install [lsp-mode](https://github.com/emacs-lsp/lsp-mode) and Dylan mode.
   Both of these are available from MELPA.

2. When you jump to another `.dylan` file, that file does not automatically
   have LSP enabled so you must use `M-x lsp` again. To make this automatic,
   add this to your emacs init file:

       `(add-hook 'dylan-mode-hook 'lsp)`

3. Start emacs and make sure that `lsp-dylan.el` is loaded. For example:

     `emacs --load=/path/to/lsp-dylan/lsp-dylan.el`

   You will probably want to modify your Emacs init file to load the file.

4. Open a Dylan source file and type `M-x lsp` to start the client (unless you
   added the hook above, in which case it started automatically).

The client starts the LSP server (the `dylan-lsp-server` executable) and
connects to it.

The emacs client has a customization group "lsp-dylan" which is a member of the
"Language Server (lsp-mode)" group, and has the following variables:

* `lsp-dylan-exe-pathname`
* `lsp-dylan-extra-command-line-options`
* `lsp-dylan-log-pathname`
* `lsp-dylan-open-dylan-release`

These are documented in the customization interface within emacs. Use `M-x
customize-group` `lsp-dylan` to customize these variables.

## Visual Studio Code Usage

These instructions were tested on Linux and macOS.

1.  Install Visual Studio Code and `npm`.
2.  The VS Code extension is in the folder `vscode-dylan`. It is necessary to
    run `npm install` in this folder before starting the extension for the
    first time, and any time a git pull updates the dependencies.
3.  Open the `vscode-dylan` folder in VS Code.
4.  In the debug viewlet, click the green play arrow (Launch Extension) or
    press `F5`.
5.  A build process will begin in 'watch mode'; whenever the source is changed,
    the extension will be rebuilt. It is possible to debug the VS Code
    extension in this window, set breakpoints, watch variables and so on.
6.  A new VS Code window will open with the extension running.
7.  Open a folder with a Dylan project in it.
8.  If `dylan-lsp-server` is on the system path, it will be found. Otherwise,
    open the Settings *in the new extension window*, find the Dylan section
    under Extensions, and edit the path to the LSP server. The full, absolute
    pathname to the executable needs to be specified. It is usually better to
    set this in the 'User' scope, otherwise it will only apply to that
    particular project.
9.  It should now be possible to use the extension window to edit Dylan code
    using LSP.
10. If the VS Code extension is changed, it is necessary to restart the
    extension host, or just close and re-open the extension window.
